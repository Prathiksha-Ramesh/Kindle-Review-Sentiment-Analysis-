## Project Overview

The **Kindle Review Sentiment Analysis** project aims to classify Kindle reviews based on their sentiment. The key steps in this project include:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature extraction using NLP techniques
- Model training and evaluation
- Model deployment (if applicable)

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **all_kindle_review.csv**, which contains Kindle reviews. Each review is labeled with its sentiment, allowing for supervised machine learning. The dataset is preprocessed to clean the text, remove stop words, and convert text to lowercase for analysis.

## Project Structure

- **notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **all_kindle_review.csv**: The dataset file containing Kindle reviews labeled with their sentiment.
- **LICENSE**: The Apache License 2.0 file that governs the use and distribution of this project's code.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run the project, including NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Pandas.
- **.gitignore**: A file specifying which files or directories should be ignored by Git.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash 
   git clone repository link
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
``` bash 
cd your-repository-name
```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

``` bash 
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
``` 

4. Install the required dependencies:

``` bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the Jupyter notebook:

``` bash 
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
``` 

## Usage
The project can be used to train and evaluate machine learning models on the Kindle review dataset to classify the sentiment of the reviews.

### Steps to Run:
- Data Preprocessing: The text data is cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized.

- Model Training: A machine learning model is trained on the processed text data.

- Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a test set using the following metrics:

- Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score: These metrics provide insights into the model's performance for each sentiment class.
- Confusion Matrix: To visualize the performance of the classification model.
